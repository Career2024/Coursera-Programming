     <h2>How to Make Shish Kabobs
</h2>
  <p>To make shish kebabs, make sure you give yourself enough time to allow the meat to marinate for the best flavor. Two to four hours is ideal, but 30 minutes does the trick if you’re short on time. Here’s how to make shish kabobs:</p>

        <h3>At Least 1 ½ Hours Before Cooking: Marinate the Shish Kebabs</h3>
        <ul class="prep">
            Prep Time: 20 mins
            Cook Time: 25 mins
            Serves: 4
            Total Time: 16 hrs
            Cal/Serv: 626
        </ul><br>
        <ul>
            <strong>Make the spice rub.</strong> In a large bowl, mix together 2 ½ teaspoons garlic powder, 1 ½ teaspoons nutmeg, 1 ½ teaspoons cardamom, 1 teaspoon allspice, 1 teaspoon paprika, and a very generous pinch or two of kosher salt and black pepper.<br> 
<strong>Season the meat.</strong> Cut 3 pounds of steak (I use beef tenderloin) into 1 ½-inch cubes. Add the meat to the bowl with the spice rub and use your hands to rub the spices into the meat, coating it in the spices.<br>
            <strong>Prepare the marinade.</strong> Thinly slice one red onion and add to a large, deep baking dish or Tupperware container. Juice in two lemons and add 1 cup each of olive oil and red wine. <br>
            <strong>Marinate the meat</strong>. Add the seasoned meat and use your hands to work the marinade into the meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (preferably 2 to 4 hours, or overnight for a tougher cut of steak).
        </ul>
        <h3>One Hour Before Grilling: Get Ready to Grill
</h3>
  <ul>
      <strong>Get ready</strong>. Remove the meat from your fridge for one hour before grilling. If you’re using bamboo or wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least one hour to prevent sticking. Cut one red onion and 4 bell peppers (a mixture of red, green, and yellow) into pieces that are roughly the same width as the meat. 
<br>
  </ul>
  <h3>30 Minutes Before Serving: Grill the Shish Kebabs
</h3>
  <ul>
      <strong>Preheat your grill.</strong> Lightly oil the grates of a gas grill and heat for 10 minutes on high.<br>
      <strong>Prepare the skewers.</strong> Thread the meat, onion pieces (discard the slices from the marinade as they’ll be too thin), and bell peppers onto the prepared skewers. Alternate until you run out of meat–I do about 4 pieces of meat per skewer with the vegetables nestled in between. Hold onto the marinade as we’ll use it later. Season the skewers with more freshly ground black pepper.<br>
      <strong>Grill.</strong> Place the shish kabobs on the grill. Cook, turning occasionally and brushing the meat a couple of times with the marinade as you go. They’ll be done in 8 to 10 minutes, depending on how hot your grill is and how well-cooked you like your meat.<br>
      <strong>Rest before serving.</strong> Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving platter. Allow 5 minutes for the kabobs to rest before serving. Enjoy!

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add a little bit of oil and salt to the boiling water and cook the linguine according to package instructions.<br>
        Meanwhile, season the shrimp with salt and pepper and set aside.<br>
        Add the butter and olive oil to an extra-large skillet over medium-low. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, being careful not to burn it. 
<br>
        Add the shrimp and sauté just until they turn pink, about 4-5 minutes, tossing often.
<br>
        Remove from the heat and add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. 
<br>
        Toss to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.
<br>
        When the pasta is cooked, drain the water and add the noodles to the sauté pan. 
<br>
        Top with fresh parmesan cheese and toss everything gently to combine. Serve.<br>

       <p><strong>Make Seasoning</strong> by mixing all dry spices in a small bowl. Set aside.<br>
<br>
<strong>Form PattiDivide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (they will shrink). <strong>Don’t over handle the meat.</strong> Touching the meat too much will make it tougher.

Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes (for medium rare), until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger.
